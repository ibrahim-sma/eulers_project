## Solving Eulers Project problems with explanation steps using python programming:


#### **[Problem 1 -  Multiples of 3 and 5](https://github.com/ibrahim-sma/eulers_project/blob/master/problem_1.py)**

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
`Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.`



#### **[Problem 2 -  Even Fibonacci numbers](https://github.com/ibrahim-sma/eulers_project/blob/master/problem_2.py)**

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, `find the sum of the even-valued terms.`
